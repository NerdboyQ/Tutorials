# Absolute Blind Beginner's Intro to Flask Web Apps   
_This tutorial was created to serve as an intro crash course to webapp development using a python webapp development framework called "[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)". A "software framework" is basically working code that was developed by one or more programmers already that you can reference in your own code instead of "re-inventing the wheel". There are different types of frameworks, for example the CSS framework this intro will be using is "[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)"_
